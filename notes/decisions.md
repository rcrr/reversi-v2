# Decisions log — historical record

Format rules: notes/decisions\_rules.md (rigid — follow when appending to this file).

D-426 | 2026-10-04 | tools/prng.py — the R-520 reflow of the docstrings (the user's "reflow with the line width per the
         rules, code and docstrings"): MEASURED FIRST — R-520 is a ceiling (~120, every physical line: code, comments,
         docstrings) and prng.py was already compliant (545 lines, max physical line 99 chars, 0 lines over 120, no
         trailing ws; never a line over 120 in its git history, D-201 → D-425 — the test mirror max 86 and binio.py max
         87 check the same way). The user chose the rewrap anyway (asked, after the measurement): the docstrings move
         from the ~72 house wrap to the ~120 wrap — an EXPLICIT per-file deviation (the wider wrap stays in prng.py
         only; R-520 and the ~72 house wrap of the other format-passed files are untouched). WHAT: all 20 docstrings
         (the module doc, the class doc, the 15 class methods, the 3 module-level kernels) rewrapped greedy-120 by a
         one-shot script (scratch/reflow\_prng.py, gitignored): the prose paragraphs and the Args/Returns/Raises
         descriptions re-flowed (the short entries collapse to one line; the 2 long ones wrap at +4 continuation), the
         section structure (the headings, the blank lines, the Attributes (internal) block) and the indented API table
         of the module doc preserved verbatim. The # comments, the code and EVERY non-docstring line are byte-identical
         to HEAD (verified programmatically). ONE cosmetic hand-nudge beyond the greedy fill: the module-doc line break
         that would have left "- 1, so a single seed..." at the start of a line was moved one word so "2^19937 - 1"
         stays together. NO behavior change (docstrings only; the numba kernels recompile from identical code). 545 →
         485 lines. VERIFICATION: test\_prng 30/0/0 (the bit-exact goldens included); the suite via the wrapper
         1062/0/24 (unchanged); notes\_lint + the gate green at this checkin.
